## Hi there 👋, I'm Jason

I'm an IT undergraduate that loves Animation, 3DGraphics, and Artificial Intelligence. 
Love to read books about history and earth science.

I'm currently on my undergraduate studies at Petra Christian University. I majored in Computer Science and focused on Deep Learing. 
I love to try and make many different Deep Learning Models from Classification Models, Object Detection, Transformers, Generative AI, NLP, and Style Transfers.
I am currently making a Generative AI using GAN to generate cloud images based on prompt conditions.

My hobbies includes modelling with Blender, creating music, drawing anime, and reading books, especially about ancient China.
In the future, I plan to integrate all of my knowledge to make my own Animated Movies.
